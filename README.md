# Weather Forecasting System
1. This application takes the input of the historical weather data through "woo_hist" API along with current weather data through "weather stack" API and gives it to the weather model as the training model. 
2. Then it does the prediction using Linear Regression and returns the predicted output through API made using flask. 
3. The JSON output does not have labels which is the next step but has the output.
Note - Currently we are trying to test it with other ML models and develope a web app for it.
